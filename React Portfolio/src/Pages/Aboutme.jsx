      <h2>Hello everyone my name is Alexander!</h2>
      <p>
        I am born and raised in San Francisco. All my life i have been around
        tech and i seem to be really good at learning and understanding how
        things worked. I started my journey when i was 13 years old and i got my
        first iPhone. This iPhone 3Gs had a password and was carrier locked to
        At&t. I then found a way to restore the device, than jailbreak the
        device. Witch allowed me to activate the device and carrier unlock the
        device, so i could use the iPhone with any GSM carrier. At that time the
        iPhone was only sold to use under the At&t network. At the age of 13, i
        started working at a family owned cellphone repair shop. Became a
        cellphone tech, and continued learning more about all forms of tech. Now
        i found the amazing world of coding ðŸš€. Lets see where this takes me
        now!
