              Hello, my name is Alexander !
            </h2>
            <p className="lead">
              Born and raised in San Francisco. All my life i have been around
              tech and i seem to be really good at learning and understanding
              how things worked. I started my journey when i was 13 years old
              and i got my first iPhone. This iPhone 3Gs had a password and was
              carrier locked to AT&T. I then found a way to restore the device
              and then jailbreak the device this allowed me to unlock the device
              so i could use the iPhone with any GSM carrier. At that time the
              iPhone was only sold to use under the AT&T network. At the age of
              13, i started working at a family owned cellphone repair shop.
              Became a cellphone tech, and continued learning more about all
              forms of tech. Now i found the amazing world of coding ðŸš€.
